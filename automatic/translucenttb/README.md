A lightweight (uses a few MB of RAM and almost no CPU) utility that makes the Windows taskbar translucent/transparent on Windows 10.

## Features

* Advanced color picker supporting alpha and live preview to change the taskbar's color.
* Taskbar states (choose one - color can be customized on every state except Normal):
    * Normal: Regular Windows style. (as if TranslucentTB was not running)
    * Opaque: Tinted taskbar, without transparency.
    * Clear: Tinted taskbar.
    * Blur: Will make the taskbar slightly blurred.
    * Acrylic: Will give the taskbar an appearance similar to Microsoft's Fluent Design guidelines.
* Dynamic modes (these can be used together and each of them provides a taskbar state and color you can customize):
    * Dynamic Windows: Will change the taskbar to a different appearance if a window is currently maximised.
    * Dynamic Start Menu: Will change the taskbar appearance when the start menu is opened.
    * Dynamic Cortana: Will change the taskbar appearance when Cortana (or the search menu if Cortana is disabled) is open.
    * Dynamic Timeline: Will change the taskbar appearance when the Timeline is open.
* Ability to show or hide the Aero Peek button. Can be customized at will or dynamic.
